    "Tribal fishery managers are interested in whether the mercury levels in local fish belly fat exceeds this amount. They are also interested in if the amount of mercury in fish is connected to fish size. \n",

    "From Lesson 1, we learned that we can reference columns in a data frame using `$`. Next we will use functions applied to the `mercury` column, starting with the `mean()`."
