    "As of now, our data for water temperature for Stream A and B exists in a separate data frame from the dissolved oxygen concentrations for Stream A and B. For K‚Äôavi Fish and Wildlife managers to truly understand what‚Äôs going on, they need to analyze water temperature and dissolved oxygen together. To do this, we need to change how our data is set up in each data frame and then merge these data frames together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manipulating data so that it is formatted in a way that we can easily and reliably analyze is called ‚Äúdata wrangling‚Äù. In R, we like our data to be ‚Äútidy‚Äù. This means we don‚Äôt want duplicate columns for the same variable. For example, in the stream_temp dataset, we have two columns for temperature, because we have a column for the water temperature of Stream A and the water temperature of Stream B. In a ‚Äútidy‚Äù version of thus dataset, we want all the temperature values to be in the same column.\n",
