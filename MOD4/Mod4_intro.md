# Introduction

Members of the K'avi tribe have managed a forest on their lands for decades. Recently, tribal forestry managers have started collecting data from a few different sites in the forest. They would like to set up a location for managing and harvesting Douglas firs for lumber. It is your job to analyze the data and determine which of the proposed sites would be the best for a harvest.

The K'avi want to choose a site that is the most productive, or in other words, has the greatest average board feet value for a given time period. Board feet are a unit of measurement that expresses the volume of logs and standing timber.

They have also found throughout the time that they have been caring for the forest, that there are many factors that affect the quality of a given site. Components such as altitude, aspect, soil, and rainfall, as well as the combination of these factors have an effect on the productivity of a site. 

1. Altitude affects productivity by shortening the length of the growing season and lowering the mean temperature. At high altitude, growth begins late and stops early, therefore making them less productive.

2. Aspect also affects productivity, as sites that face north, northeast, and east are more fertile (likely due to the sun's rays having less of an effect on the soil's dampness). Aspects that faced south to west had variable affects. Also, sites with south, southwest, and south aspects were less productive.

3. Soil must have the necessary substances to meet the conditions needed to grow. The most productive sites have deep, well-drained sandy loam soils, with the second-most being clay soils, and the least productive being gravel soils.

4. Rainfall, especially when it is abundant, greatly increases the tree growth at a site. The most productive sites have an annual precipitation of over 60 inches with less productive sites having an annual precipitation of less than 30 inches. 

Below are short descriptions of the sites the K'avi managers have been collecting data on:
  
1. Site 1: At an altitude of 2,000 feet, an aspect that faces south to west, and annual precipitation of less than 40 inches
2. Site 2: Faces northeast, has well-drained, sandy loam soil and an altitude of 1,500 feet.
3. Site 3: Rainfall of less than 20 inches annually, a southern aspect, and gravel soil
4. Site 4: Sandy loam soil, an altitude of 1,600 feet and 65 inches of rainfall annually.

## Data science topics covered:

* Exploring the data 

* Summary statistics

* Choosing a site

* Combining the data

* Calculating statistics from the combined data

* Creating a table 

* Graphing

* Recap

## Learning goals for this module:

The goal of the first day of this module is to review what you have learned from the previous 3 modules and use that knowledge to answer questions about data more independently. More specifically:

1. Min, max, median, mean review

2. Exploring data sets

3. Combining data sets

4. Creating graphs

5. Using quantitative and qualitative data to make decision about which site is the most productive

6. Data visualization

## Notes for Instructors: 

The goal of the second day of the forestry module is to have the students focus on recommendations for management based on data science with a strong emphasis on how to best make and present graphs that are accessible and helpful for a specific audience. 

Our second goal for this module is to show the students some online resources for improving their graphs to show these resources as a tool for expanding their comfort with R in the future. 


**Additional notes about the lesson**

In keeping with earlier modules we tried to include answers to the more data-science focused questions but many of the questions in this module are intentionally open ended so we did not provide potential answers to those questions. 

Our graphing theory information was mainly inspired by these resources: 

* Chapter in a book about ggplot: https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html
* Article about data visualization in environmental science for general audiences: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815216305990
* Paper about the science of data visualization: https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.library.nd.edu/doi/10.1177/15291006211051956
* Conference presentation about illustrating science for a non-specialist audience: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE1ZefOJRLQ
