paragraph about using the modules, slides, and supporting documents 

[Teacher's guide for setting up and running the first module in R studio](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGjgAcD7NU/nMGGZvbrTeUeUVP42gQvdQ/view?utm_content=DAGjgAcD7NU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h1ffc817fbc)

## More information 

**Who is the intended audience?**

These were originally designed for students at a tribale college in Montana in the Fish and Wildlife department, however the content is for anyone interested in learning R and data science using tribal environmental applications. Starting at module 1, these were created for a learner with little to no coding experience. 


**How long will each module take?**

This will depend on the situation, but in the use of the modules for a lab course, the modules were taught weekly for 2 hours over a 10 week quarter. 

**What is the suggested workflow?**

If you are using this for a classroom setting, we suggest you allocate time for discussion and group work. 
At the beginning of each meeting there was instruction and discussion, followed by the second half of class where students worked collaboratively in R. Sometimes, the discussions took up to an hour because students needed more support to upload files, import data, and understand the syntax of R.
