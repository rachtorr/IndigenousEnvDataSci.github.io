# Welcome

</br> 

We are an interdisciplinary group of scientists and educators developing culturally-aware environmental data science modules for undergraduate classrooms and workshops. We are looking to grow our earth and environmental data sciences community and to support undergraduate Indigenous students through mentorship, research opportunities, and preparation for graduate programs.  

## For Instructors 

All of our material can be found on our [github organization](https://github.com/IndigenousEnvDataSci) as different repositories. If you are familiar with github, feel free to fork a repository to modify or use the material. If you are not familiar with github, you can download the source code for your own use ([instructions on how to do that here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github)). Contact Rachel.Torres@humboldt.edu with any questions.

This site includes the following: 

1. [About us](about-section)
2. [Getting started with R:](R-section) instructions for how to download and set up R for modules
3. [K'avi Code:](water-section) workshop on visualizing water quality data with culturally relevant sites. This section tells the story that builds context for the data analysis in the other modules. 
4. [Environmental Justice modules:](EJ-section) includes four modules in development that cover a range of topics in ecology and R.
