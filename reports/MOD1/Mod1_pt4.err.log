#For this plot, we want to see the distributions of mercury in the fish and how many of them are above the EPA's recommended levels
#ggplot is the function that we are using to create a plot. aes() is used to tell ggplot what we want to see on each axis, in this case x= 'fish' and y= mercury. x="fish" indicates that the x axis doesn't have a variable and is titled fish. This allows us to look at the variation in lengths of fish independent of another variable.
ggplot (fish_1998, aes(x= 'fish', y= mercury))+
#Since ggplot is just a function to create plots, we need to further specify what kind of plot it should create. We can do this by using the geom_jitter function, which will create the jitter plot seen below. We can also add a few more parameters to the graph, such as changing the width of the points (width = 0.1).
#The jitter plot is a variation on the scatterplot, but it separates the data so that we can distinguish how many points are above the unsafe mercury level. To see the difference, try geom_point() and then geom_jitter()
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1)+
#We can also add shapes to the plot. Here we added a line to show where  the EPA's guideline for unsafe levels of mercury in fish would fall. To create  this we used the geom_hline() function which simply creates a horizontal line at a y-intercept that you set. We can also adjust the color and appearance of the line with color = 'red'.  
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.46, linetype= "dashed", color= "red", linewidth=1)+
#This allows us to relabel the x-axis
  xlab("fish")+
#This allows us to relabel the y-axis
  ylab("mercury (ug/g)")+
#This allows us to title the graph
  ggtitle("1998 Mercury Distribution")+
#This adjusts the non-data components of the plot, so the titles, labels, background, and legends among other aspects.
